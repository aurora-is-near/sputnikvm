//! The block body: the lists a header commits to.

//! [`BlockBody`] holds signed transactions and, from Shanghai onward, validator withdrawals. Their

//!
//! Ommers are not represented because this crate executes post-merge blocks only; the codec writes
//! an empty ommers list and validation requires the corresponding constant header root.
