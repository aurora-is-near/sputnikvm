//! Error types for block execution and validation.
//!
//! Errors are layered by scope:
//!
//! - [`InvalidHeader`] — the block environment is inconsistent with the active hardfork;
//! - [`InvalidTransaction`] — a transaction fails pre-execution validation;
//! - [`BlockExecutionError`] — the top level: wraps the two above (via [`InvalidEvmContext`])
//!   and adds block-level execution failures and post-execution header mismatches.
